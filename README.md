# ETL with PySpark
Have you ever wondered how companies handle massive amounts of data every day? Enter the world of ETL with
PySpark â€“ a powerful combination that's revolutionizing data processing!

## What is ETL?
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, and Load. It's the secret sauce behind turning raw data into valuable insights.
Imagine you're baking a cake:
Extract: Gathering all your ingredients (data) from different places
Transform: Mixing and preparing the ingredients (processing the data)
Load: Putting the cake in the oven (storing the processed data)

## Enter PySpark: Your Data Processing Superhero
PySpark is like having superpowers for data processing. It's the Python API for Apache Spark, a lightning-fast data
processing engine. With PySpark, you can handle enormous datasets that would make your regular laptop break a
sweat!

## ETL Magic with PySpark
Let's break down how PySpark makes ETL a breeze:
## 1. Extract: Gathering Your Data
PySpark can read data from various sources:
# Reading a CSV file
df = spark.read.csv("your_data.csv", header=True)
