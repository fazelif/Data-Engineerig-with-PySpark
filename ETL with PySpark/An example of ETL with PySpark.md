# Designing an ETL Pipeline: Merging Data from PostgreSQL and MySQL into a Lakehouse

In this project, you need to create a data infrastructure that collects data from two databases, **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL**, and consolidates it into a **Target** that can meet the needs of three groups (BI analysts, reporting managers, and ML engineers). Below are the necessary steps to carry out this project in a **step-by-step** manner on a Windows environment without using Docker:

### **Step 1: Design the Target Architecture**
First, you need to design your data architecture. The proposed architecture for this project is as follows:
1. **Data Collection and Transfer (ETL/ELT):** Data is extracted from **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** and transferred to the Target periodically or in Near Real-Time.
2. **Proposed Target: Lakehouse Architecture**
   - **Why Lakehouse?**
     - It combines a **Data Warehouse** (for BI and reporting) and a **Data Lake** (for storing large amounts of data and advanced analytics).
     - It supports both structured and semi-structured data.
     - Modern tools like Apache Spark and Delta Lake allow you to manage data efficiently.
3. **Proposed Technology for Target:** 
   - Use **Apache Parquet** or **Delta Lake** for managing Lakehouse data.
   - Data processing can be managed with **Apache Spark**.

### **Step 2: Prepare the Windows Environment**
1. **Install Necessary Tools:**
   - **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL:** If not already installed, install these two databases on Windows.
   - **Python:** Use Python for scripting and executing ETL operations.
     - Required tools:
       - Python libraries like `pandas`, `sqlalchemy`, `mysql-connector-python`, `psycopg2`, and `pyarrow`.
   - **Spark Standalone:** Install Apache Spark on Windows for processing and managing data.
   - **Power BI Desktop:** For data analysis and dashboard creation.
2. **Set Up Database Connections:**
   - Ensure you have access to both **PostgreSQL** and **MySQL** databases. Check that firewalls or network settings do not hinder your connection.

### **Step 3: Extract Data from Databases**
1. **Write a Python Script to Extract Data:**
   - Use `sqlalchemy` to connect to PostgreSQL and MySQL.
   - Extract data in the form of a DataFrame using `pandas`.
   - Example of connecting to PostgreSQL:
     ```python
     from sqlalchemy import create_engine
     import pandas as pd
     
     # Connect to PostgreSQL database
     engine = create_engine('postgresql+psycopg2://username:password@host:port/dbname')
     query = "SELECT * FROM table_name"
     data = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
     print(data.head())
     ```

   - A similar connection for MySQL:
     ```python
     engine = create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@host:port/dbname')
     ```

2. **Save Data as Parquet Files:**
   - Save the extracted data in **Parquet** format, which is suitable for fast processing:
     ```python
     data.to_parquet('data.parquet')
     ```

---

### **Step 4: Create the Target (Lakehouse)**
1. **Set Up Delta Lake:**
   - Install and configure Apache Spark.
   - Use Delta Lake (the library associated with Spark) to manage data.
   - Convert Parquet files to Delta Table:
     ```python
     from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
     
     spark = SparkSession.builder \
         .appName("DataLake") \
         .config("spark.sql.extensions", "io.delta.sql.DeltaSparkSessionExtension") \
         .config("spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog", "org.apache.spark.sql.delta.catalog.DeltaCatalog") \
         .getOrCreate()
     
     df = spark.read.format("parquet").load("data.parquet")
     df.write.format("delta").save("path_to_delta_table")
     ```

2. **Create Delta Tables:**
   - Create data tables that include aggregate data (for BI) and detail data (for reporting).

---

### **Step 5: Visualization and Analysis Tools**
1. **Power BI:**
   - Connect the data stored in Delta Lake or Parquet files to Power BI.
   - Power BI has the capability to connect directly to Parquet files or databases.
   - Design dashboards based on the needs of BI analysts.
2. **Data Modeling:**
   - For ML, load data from the Delta Table and process it with ML tools (such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow).
